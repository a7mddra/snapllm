# TODO for SnapLLM

- **Support multiple AI providers via OpenAI-compatible library**:
  Decouple the application from the Google Gemini SDK. Integrate a library like `openai` (which supports multiple providers) to allow users to configure and use APIs for GPT, Claude, Grok, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

- **Add support for local LLMs**:
  Allow users to run LLMs locally using Ollama or LM Studio.

- **Investigate an alternative to ImgBB for Google Lens**:
  Research and integrate a more privacy-focused or self-hosted solution for the temporary image hosting required by the "Open in Lens" feature.

- **Add support for right-to-left languages**:
  Add support for right-to-left languages such as Arabic and Urdu.
